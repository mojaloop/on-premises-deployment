This repository contains code, documentation and other artefacts that support the deployment of Mojaloop software in production quality on-premises scenarios.

## On-Premises Deployment Recommendations

The Mojaloop Foundation recommends:
1. That on-premises deployments be one or more (e.g. for environment separation) single-purpose cluster(s) of commodity bare-metal server nodes.
2. That the bare-metal server nodes should run [Kairos](kairos.io) immutable Kubernetes on Linux operating systems for hosting Mojaloop software containers.


## Cluster Provisioning
